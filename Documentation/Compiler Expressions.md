# Compiler Expressions

Compiler expressions are expressions that directly affect the compiled code, or that require compile-time execution.

A simple example is Macros, whilst a more complex example is directly inserting C code.

All Compiler Expressions start with a `$` followed by a keyword, and then arguments are parsed from the rest of the line.
